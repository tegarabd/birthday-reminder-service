# üéÇ Birthday Reminder Service

This repository contains two NestJS applications:

1. **User Management API**: Handles user CRUD operations (with MongoDB)
2. **Birthday Worker**: Sends birthday greetings to users at **9 AM local time** using Agenda and MongoDB.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Setup Environment Files

#### `user-api/.env`
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/birthday-db
PORT=3000
```

#### `birthday-worker/.env`
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/birthday-db
PORT=3001
REMINDER_HOUR=9
REMINDER_MINUTE=0
```

### 2. Run the Application with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> This starts MongoDB, the User API at `localhost:3000/api`, and the birthday worker in background.

## üß† Design Decisions

- **Decoupled Architecture**: The user API and birthday worker are independently deployable and scalable.
- **Agenda for Scheduling**: Reliable job scheduling using MongoDB-backed Agenda.
- **Timezone Support**: Jobs run at **9 AM local time** using `moment-timezone`.
- **Job Persistence**: Jobs remain scheduled even after restarts.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Assumptions

- Valid [IANA timezones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) are required.
- Messages are plain text and log-based.
- Year in birthday date is used for scheduling the next closest birthday.
- Both services share the same MongoDB instance defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
